Information itself is stored in `mongodb`. `techcor` tool can be used in CI environments to automatically collect metrics (like coverage and build time).\r\n\r\nIn future, it is planned to have web interface for doing same operation as with cli `techcor` tool. For now, use `techcor --help` to get information about supported operations and commands.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* Add new project\r\n\r\n        techcor add project_name\r\n\r\n* Add new metric\r\n\r\n        techcor add_metric --mt number --pn project_name metric_name\r\n\r\n* List unit tests count for all ruby projects\r\n\r\n        techcor list --fm \"{'Name' => 'name', 'Unit tests' => 'property(\\\"unit tests count\\\").value'}\" \"property('technology') == 'ruby'\"\r\n\r\nCode is not released as a separate gem, but will be in a nearest future.\r\n","tagline":"Collector of project metrics"}
